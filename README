| ww-web: A simple web interface to Warewulf              |
===========================================================

ww-web is a very basic web interface for Warewulf, an HPC-
oriented provisioning system developed out of 
Berkeley National Lab. 

It's currently built on Dancer, a simple RESTful framework
for Perl, and the Warewulf Perl API.

To run a Dancer test server, run "perl wulf-dance.pl" as root. 
Then point your browser to port 3000 on this machine.
