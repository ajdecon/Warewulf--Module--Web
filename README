| ww-web: A simple web interface to Warewulf              |
===========================================================

ww-web is a very basic web interface for Warewulf, an HPC-
oriented provisioning system developed out of 
Berkeley National Lab. 

It's currently built on Dancer, a simple RESTful framework
for Perl, and the Warewulf Perl API.

To run using the development server, run 
"perl Warewulf-Module-Web/bin/app.pl"

To run in Apache on port 8080, copy warewulf-web.conf into
your httpd/conf.d directory and restart apache.
