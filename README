| ww-web: A simple web interface to Warewulf              |
===========================================================

ww-web is a very basic web interface for Warewulf, an HPC-
oriented provisioning system developed out of 
Berkeley National Lab.  It's currently built on Dancer, a 
simple RESTful framework for Perl, and the Warewulf Perl API.

Dependencies include:
 - warewulf-common, warewulf-provision and warewulf-vnfs
 - Dancer
 - Plack::Runner
 - Template Toolkit
 - Apache with Plack::Handler::Apache2, or any 
   PSGI-capable web server.

======================= RUNNING ==========================
To run using the Dancer development server, run 
"perl Warewulf-Module-Web/bin/app.pl"

To run in Apache on port 8080, edit warewulf-web.conf and
copy it into your httpd/conf.d directory, then restart 
httpd.

============== IMPORTANT: ROOT PRIVILEGE =================
The DHCP and Pxelinux facilities in the Warewulf API make
changes to dhcpd.conf and to files in the tftpboot to 
control provisioning. This requires root-level privileges.
To implement this, the webapp calls a setuid C-wrapper binary 
bin/provision to a Perl script bin/provision.pl, which
triggers the update. Make sure that bin/provision is owned
by root, but nothing else should be. The source to this
binary is in csrc/provision.c.

I really need to find a better way to do this: the Perl
script implements some argument checking, but it's still
not best practices.
